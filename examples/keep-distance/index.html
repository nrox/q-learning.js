    This could be used in a game, to train agents to have a particular behavior.
    In this case, the blue points are all ruled by the same state machine, and
    we want to improve their behavior. The red point is an agent which should be avoided.
    The green points can move only to empty spaces. The actions are therefore either to move to an empty space or to stay.
    The red point moves according to a predefined periodic path.
